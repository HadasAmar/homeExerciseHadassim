# Exercises and Projects - Hadassim 5.0

This folder contains all the exercises I completed as part of the Hadassim 5.0 course. Each folder represents a separate exercise.

## Exercises:

- **Exercise 1**: Analyzing Large Log Files and Time Series Data (Python)
- **Exercise 2**: Building a Family Relationship Table (SQL)
- **Exercise 3**: Answering Questions about Hardware/Electronics (PDF)
- **Exercise 4**: Managing Orders Between Suppliers and Store Owners + Bonus (React + Node.js + MongoDB)

## Exercise 1 - Analyzing Large Log Files and Time Series Data

The exercise involves analyzing large log files and time series data. The first task is to write code to split a large log file (`logs.txt`), count the most frequent error codes, and merge the results. The second task involves processing a CSV file (`time_series.csv`), performing data validation, calculating hourly averages, and segmenting the data by time.

**Files**:
- **logs.txt** - A large text file with error codes.
- **time_series.csv** - A CSV file containing time series data.
- **time_series.parquet** - A PARQUET file containing time series data.

## Exercise 2 - Building a Family Relationship Table (SQL)

This exercise involves creating tables that describe family relationships between people. There is a `Person` table containing personal information, and a second table called `Family_Relationships` needs to be created, which will show the relationships between individuals (such as father, mother, brother, sister, spouse, etc.).

**Files**:
- **family.sql** - A SQL file containing queries to create the tables and relationships.

## Exercise 3 - Hardware/Electronics (PDF)

No installations are required. All the material is provided in the PDF file.

## Exercise 4 - Managing Orders Between Suppliers and Store Owners (React + Node.js + MongoDB)

This exercise involves managing orders between suppliers and store owners using React on the client side, and Node.js + MongoDB on the server side.

**Server Side**: Node.js groceryStoreServer  
**Client Side**: React grocery-store-client
